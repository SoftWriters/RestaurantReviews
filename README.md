RestaurantReviews
=================

The Problem
-----------
We are in the midst of building a mobile application that will let restaurant patrons rate the restaurant in which they are eating. As part of the build, we need to develop a web API that will accept and store the ratings and other sundry data from a publicly accessible interface. 

For this project, we would like you to build this API. Feel free to add your own twists and ideas to what type of data we should collect and return, but at a minimum your API should be able to:

1. Get a list of restaurants by city
2. Post a restaurant that is not in the database
3. Post a review for a restaurant
4. Get of a list of reviews by user
5. Delete a review

Additional Information
----------------------
This exercise is used to help us get a better picture of how you approach and solve for a given problem.  Your submission will be evaluated based on a variety of criteria including, but not limited to, product quality, demonstrated knowledge of system design and coding best practices, completeness, and ease of use from a consumer and engineering teammate perspective.  The completed solution should give us a good picture of your abilities and style, so feel free to use the programming language and tools with which you are most comfortable. 

Prior to submission, please fork this repository.  If your solution includes code auto generated by a development tool, please use an additional commit to clearly separate it from your own work.  When you have completed your solution, please issue a pull request to notify us that you are ready. 

Have fun!
