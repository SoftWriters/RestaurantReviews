RestaurantReviews
=================

This exercise implements a RESTful API against an EF Core In-memory database instance. In general the API adds, updates, deletes and retrieves data.

Design Decisions and Assumptions:
--------------------------------
- I approached this exercise as if this code was part of a larger system so I did not focus on doing a UI.
- For simplicity, all restaurants in the exercise are located in the U.S. A more robust system would not have this limitation.
- For simplicity, cities are unique by city and state. There are not 5 Mechanicsburg, PAs in the exercise. A more robust system would not have this limitation by adding geodata (i.e. longitude and longitude).
- For simplicity, restaurants are unique by name. A more robust system would not have this limitation by using geodata.
- For simplicity, city searches are limited to exact names. You have to enter the exact city name. If you searches for Pittsburgh, you won't get Mt. Lebanon or Lawrenceville restaurants.
- Phone numbers and zip codes are generated.
- For convenience, we are supplying the GUID for the record IDs. A more robust system would use autogenerated data for the id (i.e. autonumbering, GUIDs, etc.)
- All data is ASCII not Unicode. Disclaimers about a more robust system apply.
- Authorization and Authentication are assumed.

Improvements: 
-------------
Design choices leave open the opportunity to make improvements. I addition to the comments above, I'd add the following to make the API more robust:

- Logging - logging should be added for try/catches and other places where we'd like to capture information (i.e. startup, shutdown, data updates, etc.) Logs should go to something like ElasticStack.
- Unit testing
- Adding geodata (i.e. longitude and longitude). so you could do searches by distance/radius from a city.
- Add EF migration code against a real database like SQL Server.
- Referential Integrity: the In-memory data store doesn't support it because it is meant for demos.
- Implement Authorization and Authentication. We could use OAth, API keys or various other methods if we wanted to properly flesh this out.

Testing the API
---------------
To add restaurant data via the API, run the bash shell script supplied in the LoadRestaurant.sh script in the Tests. I used git bash but any bash shell should work. You could use POSTMAN too.

A number of Reviews are available for loading using the LoadReviews.sh bash script. I've also supplied a POSTMAN collection see the Restaurant_Review.postman_collection.json file in the TestData

The supplied POSTMAN requests to test the exercise requirements (by name from the collection):
- Post a restaurant that is not in the database: CreateRestaurant
- Post a review for a restaurant: CreateReview

Deleting data
-------------
Here are some commands to run in POSTMAN to delete data:
- Delete a restaurant: DeleteRestaurant
- Delete a review: DeleteReview

PUTting/Updating data
---------------------
Here are some commands to run in POSTMAN to update data:
- Update a restaurant: UpdateRestaurant
- Update a review: UpdateReview

GETting data
------------
Here are some commands to run in POSTMAN to retrieve data via the API:
- Get a list of restaurant by city: 'GetRestaurantsByCity Akron' and 'GetRestaurantsByCity Lebo'(after running UpdateRestaurant)
- Get a list of reviews by user: GetReviewsByUserName. The file duplicate reviewers.txt contains users that have nore than one review.
