The Problem
We are in the midst of building a mobile application that will let restaurant patrons rate the restaurant in which they are eating. As part of the build, we need to develop a web API that will accept and store the ratings and other sundry data from a publicly accessible interface.

For this project, we would like you to build this API. Feel free to add your own twists and ideas to what type of data we should collect and return, but at a minimum your API should be able to:

Get a list of restaurants by city
Post a restaurant that is not in the database
Post a review for a restaurant
Get of a list of reviews by user
Delete a review
