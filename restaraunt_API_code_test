API Design principle and thoughts: 

The design requirements are basic to begin with building this API but are straighforward enough to get us going. I understand the following requirements; 
    -We need a list of restaraunts by city - (2)
    -We need to be able to ADD a restaurant that is not currently in our DB - (4)
    -We need to be able to post a review for a restaurant - (7)
    -We need to view a list of reviews from a specific user - (10)
    -We need to be able to delete a review - (8)
